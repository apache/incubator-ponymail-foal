# Configuration Reference

The Pony Mail Foal server is configured via a YAML file (default:
`server/ponymail.yaml`). A sample file is provided at
`server/ponymail.yaml.example`.

This document describes all available configuration keys, their types,
defaults, and behavior. Keys are grouped by section.

---

## `server`

Controls the HTTP API server binding.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | integer | `8080` | TCP port the API server listens on |
| `bind` | string | `0.0.0.0` | IP address to bind to. Use `127.0.0.1` to restrict to localhost, or `0.0.0.0` for all interfaces |

Example:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  bind: 127.0.0.1
```

---

## `database`

OpenSearch connection settings. You can connect either by full URL
(`dburl`) or by individual host/port/prefix components.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `dburl` | string | `""` | Full OpenSearch URL (e.g. `http://localhost:9200/`). When set, takes precedence over `server`/`port`/`secure` |
| `server` | string | `localhost` | OpenSearch hostname (used when `dburl` is not set) |
| `port` | integer | `9200` | OpenSearch port (used when `dburl` is not set) |
| `secure` | boolean | `false` | Use SSL/TLS for the OpenSearch connection (used when `dburl` is not set) |
| `url_prefix` | string | `""` | URL path prefix for OpenSearch (used when `dburl` is not set, e.g. for reverse-proxied OpenSearch) |
| `db_prefix` | string | `ponymail` | Index name prefix. Indices will be named `{db_prefix}-mbox`, `{db_prefix}-source`, etc. |
| `max_hits` | integer | `5000` | Maximum number of emails returned in a single search query |
| `pool_size` | integer | `15` | Number of async OpenSearch connections in the pool. Must be ≥ 1 |
| `max_lists` | integer | `8192` | Maximum number of mailing lists to track |

Example:
```yaml
database:
  dburl: http://localhost:9200/
  db_prefix: ponymail
  max_hits: 15000
  pool_size: 15
  max_lists: 8192
```

---

## `tasks`

Background task scheduling.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `refresh_rate` | integer | `150` | Interval in seconds between background index refreshes (list counts, activity stats) |

Example:
```yaml
tasks:
  refresh_rate: 150
```

---

## `ui`

Controls UI behavior, email composition, and administration features.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `wordcloud` | boolean | `false` | Enable word cloud generation in search results |
| `mailhost` | string | `""` (disabled) | SMTP host for sending replies via the web UI. Format: `hostname` or `hostname:port` (default port 25). Leave empty to disable web replies |
| `sender_domains` | string | `""` (disabled) | Space-separated list of allowed recipient domains for web replies. Use `*` to allow all. Supports glob patterns (e.g. `*.apache.org`) |
| `traceback` | boolean | `true` | When `true`, API errors show full Python tracebacks to the client. Set to `false` in production to log tracebacks to stderr instead (an error ID is shown to the client for correlation) |
| `mgmtconsole` | boolean | `false` | Enable the administrative management console (hide/unhide/delete/edit emails via the web UI). Requires admin OAuth credentials |
| `allow_delete` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, deleted emails are fully expunged from OpenSearch (GDPR compliance). When `false`, deleted emails are merely hidden and can be recovered |
| `focus_domain` | string | `*` | Restrict the list overview to a specific domain. Use `*` for all domains. Supports glob patterns (e.g. `*.apache.org`). Useful for single-project deployments |

Example:
```yaml
ui:
  wordcloud: true
  mailhost: smtp.example.org:25
  sender_domains: "example.org *.example.org"
  traceback: false
  mgmtconsole: true
  allow_delete: true
  focus_domain: "*.apache.org"
```

---

## `tokens`

Long-term API tokens let logged-in users authenticate to the API
programmatically via an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, without the
short session-cookie lifetime. See the [API documentation](API.md#authentication).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Allow creating and using API tokens. When `false`, the `token.json` endpoint is disabled and bearer tokens are ignored |
| `default_lifetime` | integer | `2592000` (30 days) | Default token lifetime in seconds when the user does not request one. `0` means the token never expires |
| `max_lifetime` | integer | `0` (no limit) | Upper bound on token lifetime in seconds. Requests above this (and `0`/never when this is set) are clamped down to it. `0` disables the cap |
| `max_tokens` | integer | `25` | Maximum number of live tokens a single user may hold at once |
| `cache_ttl` | integer | `0` | Seconds to cache token authentication in memory. `0` disables caching (default), so revocation and expiry take effect immediately. A value above `0` avoids two OpenSearch reads per token request on hot paths, at the cost of delaying revocation/expiry by up to that many seconds |
| `cache_max` | integer | `10000` | Maximum number of entries in the in-memory token authentication cache (only relevant when `cache_ttl` > 0). The cache is flushed when it exceeds this, bounding memory use |
| `revoke_on_identity_change` | boolean | `true` | When a user logs in and their OAuth identity/permissions differ from what was last stored (e.g. after an upstream credential reset or a change in group membership), automatically revoke all of that user's API tokens, so a token minted under the old identity cannot be reused. Set to `false` to keep tokens across identity changes |

Example:
```yaml
tokens:
  enabled: true
  default_lifetime: 2592000   # 30 days
  max_lifetime: 31536000      # 1 year hard cap
  max_tokens: 25
  revoke_on_identity_change: true
```

> **Note:** Tokens are opt-in. Before setting `enabled: true`, make sure the
> `<prefix>-token` OpenSearch index exists. Fresh installs create it
> automatically via `tools/setup.py`. Existing installs must create it first,
> e.g. from the `tools/` directory:
> `python3 mappings.py --shards 1 --replicas 0 token`.
>
> Enabling API tokens is a deployment decision: because tokens outlive the
> short cookie session, an operator may prefer to leave them off, or to cap
> their lifetime with `max_lifetime`. On a shared/managed instance this should
> be coordinated with whoever runs the service (for ASF instances, Infra).

**Cutting off a user's tokens.** Two mechanisms revoke *all* of a user's tokens
at once, on top of a user revoking individual tokens via `token.json`:

- **Automatic**, on the next login after their OAuth identity changes, when
  `revoke_on_identity_change` is `true` (the default).
- **Manual**, by an administrator, via the
  [`token_purge`](API.md#mgmtjson) action of `mgmt.json` — useful when a
  credential is known to be compromised and you cannot wait for the user's next
  login.

Neither depends on `cache_ttl`: with the default `cache_ttl: 0` a purge takes
effect immediately; a non-zero cache delays it by up to that many seconds.

## `oauth`

OAuth authentication configuration. Controls which OAuth providers are
available, which are authoritative (grant access to private lists), and
who has admin privileges.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `authoritative_domains` | list | `[]` | OAuth provider domains that grant access to private lists and compose features. Must be defined as a YAML array |
| `admins` | list | `[]` | Email addresses (as seen via OAuth) that have administrative privileges (management console access). Must be defined as a YAML array |
| `google_client_id` | string | `""` | Google OAuth2 client ID (from Google Developers Console) |
| `github_client_id` | string | `""` | GitHub OAuth app client ID |
| `github_client_secret` | string | `""` | GitHub OAuth app client secret |
| `providers` | dict | `{}` | OAuth provider definitions (see below) |

### OAuth Provider Definition

Each key under `providers` defines an OAuth provider. The key name is
used as the provider identifier (e.g. `apache`, `google`, `github`).

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Display name shown on the login screen |
| `oauth_portal` | string | URL of the OAuth authorization page |
| `.oauth_url` | string | Token exchange URL (note the leading dot — keys starting with `.` are hidden from the frontend) |
| `client_id` | string | OAuth client ID (for providers that need it in the URL) |
| `scope` | string | OAuth scope to request |
| `construct` | boolean | When `true`, all provider keys are URL-encoded into the authorization request |
| `fullname_key` | string | JSON key in the OAuth response containing the user's full name |
| `email_key` | string | JSON key in the OAuth response containing the user's email |

Example:
```yaml
oauth:
  authoritative_domains:
    - googleapis.com
    - github.com
  admins:
    - admin@example.org
  google_client_id: "123456.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  github_client_id: "abc123"
  github_client_secret: "secret456"
  providers:
    google:
      name: Google OAuth
      oauth_portal: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
      fullname_key: name
      email_key: email
      client_id: "123456.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    github:
      name: GitHub OAuth
      oauth_portal: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
      client_id: "abc123"
      scope: "user:email"
      construct: true
```

---

## `archiver`

Controls threading behavior when archiving new emails. These settings
affect `tools/archiver.py` and are read from `ponymail.yaml`.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `threadinfo` | boolean | `false` | Enable storage of threading metadata (`top`, `thread`, `previous` properties) in OpenSearch |
| `threadparents` | integer | `10` | Maximum number of existing messages to query for thread information when a new message arrives |
| `threadtimeout` | integer | `5` | Timeout in seconds for each thread-parent query to OpenSearch |

Example:
```yaml
archiver:
  threadinfo: yes
  threadparents: 10
  threadtimeout: 5
```

---

## Notes

- The YAML file is loaded once at server startup. Changes require a
  server restart.
- Keys starting with `.` (dot) in OAuth provider definitions are
  filtered out before being sent to the frontend — use these for
  server-side-only secrets like token exchange URLs.
- The `ponymail.yaml.example` file does not contain all possible keys.
  This reference documents every option recognized by the server code
  (as of `server/plugins/configuration.py`).
