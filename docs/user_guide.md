### Front Page

The front page shows all available mailing list domains and their lists
with message counts. Click a domain to expand, then click a list name
to view its archive.

### List View

Once you select a list, you see the current month's emails. The sidebar
shows:

- **Calendar** — click any month to browse historical archives
- **Participants** — top contributors for the selected period

### Display Modes

Three display modes are available (toggle in the header):

| **Flat** | Shows all emails in chronological order. |

## Authentication

### Logging In

Click the profile icon (top right) to log in via OAuth. Available
providers depend on the deployment (commonly Google, GitHub, or a
custom provider like ASF OAuth).

### What Login Enables

| Feature | Anonymous | Logged In (authoritative) | Admin |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|-------|
| Browse public lists | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Browse private lists | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Compose replies | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Management console | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

"Authoritative" means the OAuth provider is listed in the server's
`authoritative_domains` configuration.

### Logging Out

Click the profile icon again and select "Log out". Your session cookie
is invalidated.

## Composing Replies

When logged in via an authoritative OAuth provider:

1. Open an email you want to reply to
2. Click the **Reply** button below the message
3. Compose your reply in the text box
4. Click **Send**

Restrictions:

- You can only reply to lists whose domain matches the server's
  `sender_domains` configuration
- The email is sent from your OAuth-verified email address
- The `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers are set automatically

---

## Permalinks

Every email has a stable permalink URL of the form:

```
https://your-instance/thread/{permalink_id}
```

Use the "Permalink" link in the email view to copy it. These URLs are
stable and suitable for sharing.

**Note:** If an email requires authentication (private list), visitors
who are not logged in will see an error. They must log in first via the
profile icon.

---

## Mbox Download

You can download a month's archive in mbox format by clicking the
download icon in the list view header. This produces a standard mbox
file suitable for import into other mail clients or tools.
