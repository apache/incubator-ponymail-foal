## Basic requirements
- Linux or other UNIX-like operating system
- ElasticSearch 7.x or higher installed
- Python 3.7.3 or higher
- PipEnv program (typically `apt install pipenv` or `yum install pipenv` etc)
- A web server of your choice with proxy capabilities

Warning: the ElasticSearch client libraries from 7.14 have strict server version checking
and will not run with the wrong version.
You may need to update the requirements.txt files in tools/ and server/ accordingly.

## Installation steps:

- Clone the Foal git repository to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-ponymail-foal.git foal`
- Install the Python requirements for the setup:
~~~shell script
cd foal/tools
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
~~~
- Install any desired optional dependencies, for example:
  - html2text (GNU GPL 3) - convert HTML to plain text
  - mailman (GPLv3+) - interface with Mailman lists
  - zope (Zope Public Licence 2.1) - required for Mailman integration
- Run the setup process:
~~~shell script
pipenv run python3 setup.py
cd ..
~~~
- Import any mailboxes you need to, using `tools/import-mbox.py` OR migrate your old Pony Mail database
  using the [Foal migrator](MIGRATING.md). 
- Install the server requirements:
~~~shell script
cd server/
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
~~~
- start the server:
~~~shell script
pipenv run python3 main.py
~~~
- use a web server like httpd or nginx to serve UI and proxy to the API. A sample httpd configuration could be:
~~~apache
# Load required modules
LoadModule proxy_module ...
LoadModule proxy_http_module ...
...
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName ponymail.example.org
    DocumentRoot /var/www/ponymail-foal/webui/
    ProxyPass /api/ http://localhost:8080/api/
    # PathInfo is needed for threads
    AcceptPathInfo On
    # Also needed for threads to be able to handle message-ids with embedded /:
    AllowEncodedSlashes On # (or NoDecode)
</VirtualHost>
~~~

A sample nginx config could be:
~~~nginx
server {
    root /var/www/ponymail-foal/webui/;
    index index.html index.htm;
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/;
    }
}
~~~


## Archiving new emails via Postfix or the likes
To set up archiving, the easiest path is to edit your `/etc/aliases` file on the machine
that receives email. If your receiving address for email is `inbox@yourmachine.tld`, your 
alias entry should look like this:
~~~text
inbox: "| /path/to/foal/tools/archiver.py"
~~~

For privately archived emails, use the `--private` flag for your command:

~~~text
inbox: "| /path/to/foal/tools/archiver.py --private"
~~~

Once you have added the entry, be sure to run the `newaliases` command to update the compiled alias list.
`archiver.py` will automatically sort out which list the email is for, if there is a List-ID header.
You can override or manually set a list using the `--lid` flag:
~~~text
inbox-somealias: "| /path/to/foal/tools/archiver.py --lid somealias@mydomain.tld"
~~~

## Setting up OAuth
By default, OAuth is enabled for the following providers:

- Google
- GitHub
- Generic (like oauth.apache.org)

None of these are marked as _authoritative_ by default. Authoritative OAuth domains 
allow users to compose emails via the UI and see private emails (unless you reshape the 
AAA plugin). Non-authoritative domains only allows the user to log in, nothing more.

To set an OAuth provider as authoritative, you need to add or uncomment the 
`authoritative_domains` section of the `oauth` configuration in `server/ponymail.yaml`:

~~~yaml
oauth:
  authoritative_domains:
    - googleapis.com
    - myoauthprovider.tld
~~~

For administrative access to certain features, such as deleting/moving email via the UI,
you can set a list of people who, via an authoritative oauth provider, will have access to
this, as such:

~~~yaml
oauth:
  authoritative_domains:
    - googleapis.com
  admins:
    - humbedooh@gmail.com
    - example@gmail.com
~~~


Currently, you will also need to enable or tweak your `webui/js/config.js` file to match your 
choice of OAuth providers, though that is subject to change.

### Setting up Google OAuth
To begin using Google OAuth, you must procure an OAUth2 client id from the 
[Gooogle Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/).
Callback URL must be oauth.html in your webui installation.

Once you have a `Client ID`, you should set it in `server/ponymail.yaml`  in the 
`google_client_id` directive. You will also need to currently set it in `webui/js/config.js`.

After this is done, OAuth should work with Google, and you may enable authoritativeness by adding 
`googleapis.com` to the `authoritative_domains` section in `server/ponymail.yaml`.

### Setting up GitHub OAuth
To begin using GitHub OAuth, create an OAuth app at the 
[GitHub Developer Console](https://github.com/settings/developers).
Callback URL must be oauth.html in your webui installation.

Once you have created your OAuth app, copy the client ID and client secret to your 
`server/ponymail.yaml` oauth section, as `github_client_id` and `github_client_secret` 
respectively.

When you've done that, you must currently also edit `webui/js/config.js` and set the 
`client_id` for GitHub to the correct value.

## Setting up web replies
It is possible to reply to emails on a list via the web interface, provided you have enabled
this feature. To do so, you must set a `mailhost` option as well as designate certain 
domains and subdomains as allowed recipients of email. This is done in the `server/ponymail.yaml`
file, under ui:
~~~yaml
ui:
  wordcloud: true
  mailhost: smtp.mydomain.tld:25
  sender_domains: mydomain.tld *.mydomain.tld
~~~

You may use wildcards in your domain names, as per standard GLOB/fnmatch rules, 
separating each entry with a single space:
- to allow email for list@mydomain.tld, sender_domains must include `mydomain.tld`
- to allow email for list@sub.mydomain.tld, you should add `sub.mydomain.tld`
- to allow email for all lists at any subdomain under mydomain.tld, you should add `*.mydomain.tld`

Only users logged in via authoritative OAuth will be able to compose replies via the
web interface.

## Online Management Console
the `ui` paragraph of the server configuration allows for enabling an administrative interface
for editing or removing emails from the archives. To enable this, set `mgmtconsole` to `true`.
For GDPR compliance (deleting an email deletes from disk), set `allow_delete` to `true`. 
If left out or set to false, deleted emails are merely hidden, and can be recovered at a later 
stage by an administrator.

~~~yaml
ui:
  mgmtconsole:     true
  allow_delete:       true
~~~

The administrative interface can be accessed by clicking on the yellow cog in the context menu 
of an email. Admins are defined in the [OAuth](#setting-up-oauth) configuration.


## Hiding tracebacks from users
By default, API errors will include a full traceback for debugging purposes. If you wish to 
instead have this be printed to the system journal (`stderr`), you can set the `traceback`
option to `false` in `server/ponymail.yaml`. This will instead print an error ID to the user, 
corresponding to a traceback in stderr. 

If the error ID is, for instance, `a06f7d4b-3a82-4ecf`, you can find the corresponding traceback
by grepping your programs output. If you are running Foal as a systemd service, you could find 
the traceback with: `journalctl --no-pager -u yourservicename | grep a06f7d4b-3a82-4ecf`

## Archiving options
To enable the storage in elasticsearch of extra properties related to
threading, the following configuation snippet can be used in the
`server/ponymail.yaml` file:
~~~yaml
archiver:
  threadinfo: yes
  threadparents: 10
  threadtimeout: 5
~~~
The `threadparents` value limits the number of existing messages that
will be queried for thread information at archive time when a new
message is received. The `threadtimeout` value limits the duration of
each query to elasticsearch.

Enabling `threadinfo` means that `top`, `thread`, and `previous`
properties will be added to each stored message. The `top` property is
a boolean, indicating whether or not the message is the start of a new
thread. The `thread` property gives the generated Foal ID of the top
of the current thread; this will be the same as the ID of the current
message if `top` is true. The `previous` property gives the generated
Foal ID of either the most recent parent message if the message is not
the top of a thread, or the top of the most recent thread otherwise.
