I did attend the meeting, and I think committers who concentrate on 
Lucene should not be discouraged from attending any similar future 
meetings.  Discussions in a meeting about Solr are not very likely to 
dive down that far into the inner workings, but even if they don't, some 
Lucene people might find the the talk about Solr to be interesting, and 
having their perspective available would not be a bad thing.

I'm very wary of making an official change to review-then-commit.  I 
fully support the ideas that went into the proposal, but I think making 
it mandatory for all commits is going to really slow things down and 
cause some problems.  It's not the way most Apache projects work, and it 
makes it a LOT harder to do quick sanity edits like fixing spelling errors.

As much as I really like the idea of more frequent reviews, I think that 
review requirements should be informal.

Most of the time a committer will know whether the changes they are 
working on fall into a "major" or "minor" category.  When it's leaning 
more towards major, I think most of us will agree that a few extra 
eyeballs looking for gotchas is a really good idea.  TLDR note:  The 
number of lines in a change is sometimes NOT an indicator of how major 
the change is.

I certainly want to seek a "looks good to me" on changes I make which 
have any significant impact.  For some of the ideas I have, if those 
ever reach the implementation phase, I think I'd want even more 
assurance that I'm not doing it wrong.  I can pledge that I will seek 
review for non-trivial changes.  I wonder if there is wording we can add 
to any official project rulebook to make such a thing mandatory, without 
a full switch.

I think that a full switch to review-then-commit (RTC) would be the 
wrong thing to do.  I think it would lead to a lot of dissent within the 
project, encouraging rivalries and cliques within the project.

If RTC is preferred by a significant majority, I will work within that 
paradigm ... but I think that it would be a short-lived experiment and 
we would be back to CTR pretty quickly.

Is it possible to vote -0.5 instead of -1?  I don't think it is.

Thanks,
Shawn
