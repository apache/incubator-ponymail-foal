Subject: [GitHub] activemq-artemis pull request: Make Topology
 non-serializable and ...
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Thu, 14 May 2015 21:35:33 +0000 (UTC)

GitHub user thiagokronig opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/pull/262

    Make Topology non-serializable and also improve constructor

    Topology serialization is already broken at this point, as its `topologyListeners` are not Serializable themselves.
    
    Also, all the `executor` logic was simplified by making it `final`, defined at the constructor.
