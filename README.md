This repository aims to contain the next generation of Apache Pony Mail,
a pure Python version of Apache Pony Mail with support for ElasticSearch 
7.x and above.

## New features in Foal:
Among other things, Foal sports the following new features:

* Improved archiver and import tools
* New, sleeker UI for the end user
* Migration tools for moving to Foal
* 100% Python backend, no Lua required
* In-place editing of emails via web UI

## Installation Guide
Please see the [installation documentation](INSTALL.md) for setup instructions.

### Current setup requirements:

* An operating system, such as:
  * Linux
  * FreeBSD
  * Windows
  * Mac OS
* Python 3.8 or higher with dependencies from `requirements.txt` in tools/ and server/ as needed.
* Web server with proxy capabilities for the UI.
* ElasticSearch 7.x or higher.


### Migration disclaimer:
_While compatible with the original Pony Mail, this will not be a drop-in replacement.
Migration of the old database is required, and most older ID generators have 
been dropped in favor of collision-secure generators._

### Known Limitations:
* Emails are filed according to the Date: header rather than arrival time.
  This can cause emails to appear in the wrong month or year or even be future-dated.
* While the underlying database can handle any number of emails a month, 
  the UI and much of the API do not scale well beyond 10,000 emails per month per list.
* Re-archiving/importing a previously hidden email will unhide it in the archive.

#### Known limitations when migrating from older Pony Mail instances:
* The database entry is entirely replaced if an email is re-imported or re-archived after a migration.
  This can result in the loss of attributes such as alternate Permalinks.
* The migration tool can drop Permalinks if two existing entries point to a sufficiently similar email
* The migration tool does not fix up badly parsed message IDs etc
* There is no longer a 1-to-1 relationship between mbox and source entries.
  This can result in orphan source entries, which has implications for privacy redaction.
* Header parsing is stricter than before; some unusual message IDs are not handled correctly.
  This affects using Foal as a replacement for Apache mod_mbox mail archives.
